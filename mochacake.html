		<p><strong>CAKE</strong><br>
3 1/2 cups flour
<br>2 teaspoons baking powder
<br>1 teaspoon baking soda
<br>1 teaspoon salt
<br>2 cups milk
<br>1 tablespoon vanilla extract
<br>2 cups brown sugar
<br>1/2 pound butter
<br>2 large eggs
<br>1 1/2 cups chocolate chips
		<br><br><p><strong>FROSTING</strong><br>

	

1 1/2 pounds in high-quality milk chocolate, finely chopped

<br>3 1/2 cups heavy cream

<br>6 tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes

<br>2 tablespoons instant espresso powder

<br>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</p>

							<p><strong>CAKE</strong><br>
			1) Preheat oven to 350°.
				<br>2) Lightly butter two cake pans.
				<br>3) Beat the brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy.
				<br>4) Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
				<br>5) Add the baking powder, baking soda and salt.
				<br>6) Mix in the flour, alternating with the milk in two equal additions.
				<br>7) Fold in the chocolate chips.
				<br>8) Divide the batter between the pans. Bake for about 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
				<br>9) Let cool on wire racks for 10 minutes then turn the cakes onto wire racks and let them cool completely.
				<br>10) Place one cake layer on a serving plate, flat side up. Spread 1 cup of the frosting on the cake. Place the second layer, flat side down, on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.

			<p><strong>FROSTING</strong><br>
				1) Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, taking care that it doesn’t boil over. Remove from the heat, add the butter, espresso powder, and vanilla, and stir until the butter melts. Pour over the milk chocolate. Let stand until the chocolate softens, about 1 minute.

<Br>2) Whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until the mixture is as thick as chocolate pudding, about 2 hours.

<br>3) Beat the chocolate mixture with an electric mixer set on high speed, just until it becomes lighter in color and spreadable, about 10 seconds. Be very careful not to overbeat, or it will separate. (In that case, melt the mixture in a stainless-steel bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Cover, refrigerate until thickened, and try again.)
